### Hi there üëã

I'm [Sebastien Dumont](https://sebastiendumont.com/). I‚Äôm a WordPress Developer and I‚Äôve worked in the web development space for more than two decades and WordPress space for over a decade, focusing on providing solutions for clients and customers alike that are deeply customizable but also very easy to use.

I‚Äôve tackled challenges were others have failed many times where my out-the-box thinking has even taken prototype projects to fully developed products in no time at all.

I‚Äôm a self-taught developer and since 2007, I‚Äôve been using WordPress to build websites. I first started using it to blog random things while learning to code.

I am the Founder of **CoCart Headless, LLC** working on a [WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce/) that provides a customizable REST API for WooCommerce designed to seamlessly decouple your online store from WordPress. Allowing you to decouple away from WordPress, and use your chosen framework to handle client-side tasks.

Skills: HTML, CSS, SCSS, PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, MySQL, SQL, WordPress, WooCommerce, Multisite, Headless, Gutenberg, Git, GitHub, Jira, Trello, Composer, GruntJS, Frontend, Backend, Full-Stack, English

* üå± I‚Äôm currently learning more about: Unit-Testing, React, GraphQL and Tailwind CSS.
