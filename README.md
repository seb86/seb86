### Hi there üëã

I'm [Sebastien Dumont](https://sebastiendumont.com/). I‚Äôve worked in the WordPress space for over a decade, focusing on providing solutions for clients and customers alike that are deeply customizable but also very easy to use.

I‚Äôm a self-taught developer and since 2007, I‚Äôve been using WordPress to build websites. I first started using it to blog random things while learning to code.

I am the Founder of [CoCart](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce/). A WordPress plugin that provides a REST API with everything you need to build fast and flexible headless stores powered by WooCommerce. I'm also Co-Founder of [Perfect](https://perfectcheckout.com/). The best and fastest, single step, customizable headless hosted checkout out there that beats the likes of Bolt, Rally and even Shopify.

* üå± I‚Äôm currently learning more about: React, GraphQL and Tailwind CSS.
